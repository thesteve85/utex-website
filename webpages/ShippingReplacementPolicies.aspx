  <strong><span class="auto-style1">Shipment Policy</span></strong><p class="auto-style3">Cultures 
  are only shipped on Mondays (or Tuesday following a Monday holiday) unless 
  requested by the customer and approved by the Business Manager.&nbsp; No 
  cultures are shipped during the weeks of Christmas and New Year&#39;s Day.<br><br>
  When an order is received by Wednesday 5pm CST of a given week, it can 
  generally be sent on the following Monday.&nbsp; If an order includes items 
  that require longer preparation times, the shipment is delayed 
  until all of the items can be packaged and shipped at the same time.<br><br>
  Some countries have restrictions that limit, control, or prohibit the import 
  of living algae.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of the customer to know which 
  laws apply to the country that is to receive the shipment.&nbsp; Shipments to 
  some countries must include an import permit to ensure that the shipment will 
  not be confiscated in transit.&nbsp; The official permit may be prepared by 
  the purchaser and sent via fax to UTEX at +1-512-471-0354.<br>
