                 <font size="2" face="Verdana">Although achieving the

                                algae in a short time is desired
                                by many who receive UTEX
                                cultures, such goals are not
                                consistent with <span lang="en-us"></span>the needs of
                                the Collection. On the contrary,
                                it is more efficient for us to
                                grow small cultures slowly, so as
                                to minimize the<span lang="en-us"> </span>use of
space,&nbsp;materials
                                and staff work, all of which
                                contribute to cost. With this
thought in
                                mind, the following account of
                                how UTEX cultures are maintained
                                is not to be interpreted as our
                                recommendations for the best
                                growth conditions and media to
                                achieve optimal growth rates and
                                large quantities of algae. Such
                                information must be acquired in
                                other literature or through
                                careful experimentation. Those
                                who receive cultures are
                                encouraged to duplicate within
                                reason the conditions used in the
                                Collection, when handling newly
                                acquired cultures, to reduce the
                                chance of losing the culture.
                                After a stock culture is
                                established, subcultures may be
                                used for testing other

<br><br>Set up: with the
exception of <i>Volvox</i>, all cultures are maintained in a single room having 
				approximately 500 square feet of floor space. The temperature of 
				the room is kept at 20 &deg;C using a chilled water cooling system 
				and air circulator. The relative humidity is kept at 50 &plusmn; 1%. Racks of metal shelves
having no lights are placed on the north wall near three windows, and cultures placed on these shelves may benefit from this natural light.
The remaining cultures are maintained in five incubators located on the perimeter of the remaining walls. The temperature in four of the incubators
is kept at 20 &plusmn; 1 &deg;C. The fifth incubator is kept at 25 &plusmn; 1 &deg;C and maintains Dasycladales and some tropical chlorophytes. Four workstations,
one each parallel to the east and west walls, and two parallel to the north wall, are equipped with a pair of 4 foot cool-white fluorescent light tubes mounted approximately 10 inches
above each of three shelves. During the life of the cultures, none are aerated or agitated.

                                usually placed on a lighted shelf
                                and allowed to grow or reproduce
                                asexually until the desired size

                                from the lights until it is
                                needed. This initial growth
                                period usually takes one to two
                                weeks, but more or less time may
                                be required. The frequency at

                                months and is determined through

<i>Menoidium</i>, <i>Rhabdomonas</i> and some

                                1663-1671); and other
                                light-sensitive algae, which are
                                adversely affected by high light
                                intensity. All reds except
<i>Porphyridium</i>, the browns, and the
                                macrophytic marine greens grow
                                well in the dimly lighted areas
                                of the culture room or in front
                                of the windows. However,
                                blue-green algae are especially
                                troublesome, because they may
                                bleach out under high light
                                intensity or otherwise achieve
                                little growth in dimly lighted
                                areas. It has been found that
                                most do well on the lighted shelf
                                when the light intensity is
                                diminished by placing a neutral
