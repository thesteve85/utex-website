<b>History, Structure, and Purposes of UTEX</b><br><br>

The Culture Collection of Algae
                        at the University of Texas at Austin, herein designated 
  as &quot;UTEX&quot;, has been in continuous 
                        operation since 1953. &nbsp;It was established by Richard
                        C. 
                        Starr at Indiana University and was moved to its present 
                        site in 1976. Dr. Starr was the Director of 
                        UTEX from its inception until his untimely death in 
                        February of 1998, at which time Jerry J. Brand became 
                        the Director.<p class="MsoNormal">The principal

resource of UTEX is its extensive 
                        collection of living algae. 
                        Nearly 2,800 different strains of algae, representing 
                        approximately 200 different genera, are provided to the 
                        public at modest charge. The Collection maintains an especially strong representation 
                        of freshwater and edaphic green algae and cyanobacteria, 
                        but includes representatives of most major algal 
                        taxa, including many marine macrophytic green and red 
                        algae. All strains in the 
                        Collection were obtained as isolates from natural 
                        sources, and no genetically altered strains are 
                        maintained. Approximately half of 
                        UTEX strains are axenic and all 
                        cultures are unialgal.</p>

                        <p class="MsoNormal">
                        The Culture Collection of Algae is administrated 
                        as an Organized Research Unit of the University of Texas 
                        in Austin through the College 
                        of Natural Sciences. Its principal administrative 
                        officer is a Director who is responsible for 
                        establishing and enforcing policies 
                        regarding the management of
                        UTEX. &nbsp;The resources of UTEX 
                        are managed through a Curator. The primary duties of UTEX 
                        staff are transferring cultures to fresh media on 
                        regular schedules, shipping cultures to users, keeping 
                        records related to sales and inventory, preparing media, 
                        and managing glassware.</p>
                        <p class="MsoNormal">
                        The principal function of UTEX is the maintenance of its 
                        diverse stock of living algae, in order to make these 
                        algal strains available to a user community 
                        worldwide at modest cost. Cultures in the Collection are used especially for research, 
                        but also for biotechnology development, 
                        teaching, water quality assessment, food for aquatic 
                        animals, and a
                        variety of other purposes. UTEX does not impose 
                        restrictions regarding the use of cultures that are 
                        purchased and does not assume 
                        any responsibility for cultures that are sold and sent 
                        away from the facility.</p>

                        UTEX is a nonprofit organization. Principal financial 
                        support is 
                        obtained through the National Science Foundation of the 
                        U.S.A. 
                        Additional support comes from the College of 
                        Natural Sciences of 
                        The University of Texas at Austin and through the sale 
                        of cultures to the user 
                        community.</p>

<b> Dr. David Nobles</b><br><br>

Dr. David R. Nobles, Jr. earned a Ph.D. in Botany from the University of Texas at Austin in 2006.  He studied under Dr. R. Malcolm Brown, Jr., a noted phycologist, microscopist, cell biologist, and leading cellulose researcher.  During his time in the R. Malcolm Brown, Jr. Laboratory, Dr. Nobles became familiar with diverse algae via the study of cell wall biosynthesis.  His doctoral research focused on the cell biology, molecular biology, and biotechnological aspects of cellulose biosynthesis by cyanobacteria.  He received the Outstanding Dissertation Award for his dissertation entitled â€œCellulose in the Cyanobacteriaâ€.  His postdoctoral research focused on the development of cyanobacteria as sources for biofuel feedstocks.  To date, he has developed methods for the cyanobacterial production of cellulose, glucose, and sucrose.  Dr. Nobles is a co-author of multiple patents based on this research and is a founding member of Phykotek, Inc., a startup company dedicated to the production of cyanobacterial feedstocks.  His current research interests include expanding the number of sequenced algal genomes; the development of novel algal systems for genetic and metabolic engineering; utilizing the amazing diversity of algae for biotechnological applications including the production of pharmaceuticals, biomass, and biofuels; and the use of algae for CO2 mitigation.  <br><br>
