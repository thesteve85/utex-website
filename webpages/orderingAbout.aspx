All strains of living algae included in the UTEX list of cultures are available to organizations and individuals, except in cases where a culture has been lost or needs attention to restore its vigor. UTEX does not impose any restrictions regarding the use of cultures purchased from the Culture Collection. UTEX does not assume responsibility for a culture or its uses after it leaves the UTEX facility.
<br><br>
<b><big>Methods of Payment</big></b><br><br>

Cultures that are purchased by individuals are paid in advance. Organizations that maintain separate 
  shipping and billing addresses may pay after receipt of cultures, provided that a purchase order number and the address to which the bill should be sent are 
  faxed on business letterhead with the order. An invoice will be mailed the day after the order is shipped. Full payment is due within 30 days of receipt of the cultures.
<br><br>
The preferred method for receiving payment is via the secure credit card form contained on-line. All credit card orders must include the type of credit card (Visa or MasterCard only), card holder name as it appears on the card, card number, and expiration date. UTEX also accepts credit card orders sent via telephone (512-471-4019), FAX (512-471-0354) or regular mail. <b>Please do not send credit card numbers via email.</b>
