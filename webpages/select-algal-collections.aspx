	  <a name="Freshwater_Diatom_Collection">Freshwater Diatom Collection</a></u></b><p>David B. Czarnecki began collecting and studying freshwater diatoms as a 
      graduate student. His collection moved with him to Loras 
      College in 1984, where it was named and recognized universally among 
      freshwater diatomists as the Loras College Freshwater Diatom Culture 
      Collection. The Collection was maintained through grants to Loras College 
      from the Iowa Science Foundation and the Iowa College Foundation. In 
      February 2006 Dr. Czarnecki requested that The Loras College Freshwater 
      Diatom Collection be transferred from Loras College to UTEX. Loras College 
      subsequently donated the entire collection to UTEX as a gift.</p>
      
      <p>Dr. Czarnecki died in May 2006. Strains from his collection that are 
      maintained at UTEX will continue to be listed as the Loras College 
      Freshwater Diatom Culture Collection in memory of Dave Czarnecki's service 
      to the community of freshwater diatomists.</p>
      
      <p>When ordering a strain from this collection, the identifying number should 
      be prefixed with &quot;FD&quot;. A culture of the requested strain may be ordered in 
      the same way as are other cultures. Please note when 
		placing an order for these diatoms it may take up to 3 weeks before 
		shipment of the order. The FD algae collection was deposited 
      with UTEX in April 2006 and formally accessioned in October 2006.</p>

     Extreme Environment Algae are strains of terrestrial algae collected 
     from various extreme environments such as Antarctica and 
     the Gobi Desert. This collection maintained by Dr. Imre Friedmann has been deposited in the Culture Collection of 
     Algae at The University of Texas. These strains have now been cryopreserved 
     and are maintained in indefinite storage under liquid nitrogen. Some of 
     them are well documented and their characteristics described; others have 
     only been identified to family. Information on the documented strains will 
     be added to this web site as time permits.</p>
     
     <p>Upon request, a living culture of the requested 
    strain will be thawed and shipped in agar, in the same 
    2-mL cryovial in within which it was cryopreserved. The 
    identifying number of the requested strain should be prefixed with
    &quot;EE&quot;. The requested 
    culture may be ordered in the same way as other cultures are ordered. Representative photos of EE 150 are displayed as thumbnails below. The extreme 
    environment algae collection was deposited in 2003 and formally accessioned into 
    UTEX February 2005.

<div><br><br><b><u><a name="Snow_Collection">Snow Collection</a></u></b><p>The culture collection of snow algae maintained by Dr. Ron Hoham at Colgate University has been deposited in the Culture Collection of Algae at the University of  Texas at Austin. The strains in this collection have all been isolated from snow and have been maintained at temperatures below 6 &deg;C since their isolation. This collection includes isolates from eastern and western North America collected over a 35-year time period, and also includes isolates from Antarctica. Multiple isolates of the same taxon are maintained to permit research at the population level.</p><p>Most of the algae in this collection are members of Chlorophyta, but several strains are yellow-green algae (Xanthophyceae) and a few are golden algae (Chrysophyceae). Nearly all strains in the collection have been cryopreserved and in the future will be maintained at UTEX only at liquid nitrogen temperature.</p><p>
	Upon request, a living culture of the requested strain will be thawed and 
	shipped in agar, in the same 2-mL cryovial in which it was cryopreserved. These strains will survive transport at room temperature and that is the most reliable way to ship, but there is concern from the depositor that allowing them to warm during shipment may select for genotypes that are not as cold-adapted. Cultures will be shipped at room temperature unless an ice pack is requested by the customer.</p><p>When ordering a strain from this collection, the identifying number should be prefixed with "SNO". A culture of the requested strain may be ordered in the same way as are other cultures. The SNO algae collection was deposited with UTEX in December 2005 and formally accessioned in July 2006.</p>

     The Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge in 
     northwest Oklahoma, USA is a moist soil habitat characterized by highly 
     fluctuating salinity (ranging from freshwater to NaCl saturation) and 
     temperature extremes (sometimes exceeding 50 &deg;C). A broad range 
     of halotolerant soil algae occur in this habitat, sometimes within 
     microbial mats or in shallow pools. Additional information can be obtained 
     at
     <a target="_top" href="http://www.okstate.edu/artsci/SPMO">www.okstate.edu/artsci/SPMO</a>.</p><p>A diverse range of Chlorophyceae, 
     Bacillariophyceae and Cyanophyceae have been isolated and provided 
     tentative identification by Dr. Andrea Kirkwood, and representative strains 
     have been deposited in UTEX by Dr. William Henley. These strains have now 
     been cryopreserved and are maintained at UTEX in indefinite storage under 
     liquid nitrogen. An additional strain (UTEX 2795 <i>Picochlorum 
     oklahomensis</i>) is maintained under serial culture.</p>
    <p>Upon request, a living 
     culture of the requested strain will be thawed and shipped in agar, in the

     in July 2005.</p>
